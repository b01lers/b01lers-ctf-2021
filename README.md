# b01lers-ctf-2021
The 2021 iteration of b01lers CTF!

# Running remote challenges

For the most part, remote challenges should run if you run `docker-compose up` in the `deploy` directory for the challenge.

For everything else:
- `src` has source code and build stuff.
- `solve` has the flag and any available writeups.
- `dist` has what we gave out during the CTF: description and released files.
- `deploy` has remote deployment files if applicable.

We're glad everyone enjoyed the CTF! Check us out at Circle City Con 8.0, our bootcamp (beginner oriented CTF) in the fall, or see you next year for the challenge round!
