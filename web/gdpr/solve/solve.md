# GDPR
- This chall is a satire on the GDPR cookie modals where you have to accept everything before continuing to the site.

- The first page animates the modal so that you can see there's a link behind the modal.

## Solutions
1. View the html and go to `/flag_policy`
1. You can also delete the modal and click the link.
1. `curl url/flag_policy`

## Flag
`bctf{annoying_but_good?}`
