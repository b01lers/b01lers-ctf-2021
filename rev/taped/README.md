The flag was encoded on a cassette tape using a modified version of the KCS
encoding standard.  The two distributed files are a binary to generate KCS encoded
wave files and the encoded flag read back from a cassette player.  The challenge
is to decode the flag from the audio. Challenge information is contained in
`dist/description.md` and the files to be distributed are `dist/tape.wav` and
`dist/encoder`.
