# SETUP

Run `make` in the src directory to generate the file `1000words.png` which is the
file that needs to be distributed.  You will need the to have `libpng` headers
and the `exiv2` command line utility.  Challenge metadata (author, title,
description) is available in `./dist/description.md`. That's pretty much it.
