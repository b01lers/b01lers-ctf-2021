The pieces are from Johann Sebastian Bach. There are some hints:

   - leftover birth year 1685
   - B.W. X... numbers at bottom
   - lots of preludiums, fugues, cantatas
   - and the challenge title B-W-V
   - and the last one is really very famous

Each sheet is about a Bach piece. If you identify the pieces and write down the corresponding Bach 
Works Catalog (BWV) numbers, you get

510 862 272 870 546 146 189 563 354 996 765 565

Interpreting this as a number in decimal, and converting that integer to a string gives

bctf{JSB/rOcKs}

Vocal pieces can easily be found by title/lyrics. Some of the other pieces require you to identify
the key. The lute piece requires a search on "Suite II" plus the key.
