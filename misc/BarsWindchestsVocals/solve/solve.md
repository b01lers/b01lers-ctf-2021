The pieces are from Johann Sebastian Bach. There are some hints:

   - leftover birth year 1685
   - B.W. X... numbers at bottom
   - lots of preludiums, fugues, cantatas
   - and the challenge title B-W-V
   - and the last one is really very famous

Each sheet is about a Bach piece. If you identify the pieces and write down the corresponding Bach 
Works Catalog (BWV) numbers, you get the solution. 

Some of the other pieces require you to identify the key. The lute piece requires a search on "Suite 
II" plus the key. Vocal pieces can easily be found by title/lyrics but there can be some ambiguity 
because multiple BWV numbers contain the same songs. So the last page contains a bit of math help:

  I + VII + 1 = 700
  V  - VI     = ?00
  XI - XII    = 200
  V  + IX     = 900


In the end, the solution is:

  510 862 272 870 546 146 189 563 354 996 765 565

Interpreting this as a number in decimal, and converting that integer to a string gives

  bctf{JSB/rOcKs}
